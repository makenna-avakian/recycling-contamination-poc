# recycling-contamination-poc
Practicing dev of databases!

A city wants to track recycling pickups and contamination. Staff can log what kind of contamination was seen, how bad it was, and later analyze:

Which routes/customers are worst offenders?

Is contamination improving over time?

Do outreach/education actions help?

We model:

- Facilities (MRFs or depots)

- Routes

- Customers & their containers

- Pickups

- Contamination events per pickup

- Education / outreach actions (like the activities form )
